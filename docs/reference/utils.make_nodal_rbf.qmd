`utils.make_nodal_rbf(x, node, rbf)`

A function that returns the value of the RBF at a given point x, with respect to a given node. The RBF is tuned to the given node.

Args:
    x (Float[Array, "dim"]): The point at which the RBF is to be evaluated.
    node (Float[Array, "dim"]): The centroid with respect to which the RBF is evaluated.
    rbf (Callable): The RBF function to be used, with signature rbf(r) where r is the Euclidean distance between the two points

Returns:
    float: The scalar value of the RBF at the given point x, with respect to the given node.
