# operators.gradient { #updes.operators.gradient }

`operators.gradient(x, field, centers, rbf=None, clip_val=None)`

Computes the gradient of the field (given by its coefficients) at position x

Args:
    x (Float[Array, "dim"]): The position at which to conmpute the gradient value
    centers (Float[Array, "nb_centers, dim"]): The centroids of the RBF to use
    rbf (callable): The rbf to use. (Currently mandadatory, despite the signature.)
    clip_val (float, optional): The limit to which to clip the value to avoid blowup. Defaults to None.

Returns:
    Float[Array, "dim"]: The gradient of the field at x
