`operators.laplacian_vals(x, field, cloud, rbf, max_degree)`

Computes the laplacian of the field (given by its values) at position x

Args:
    x (Float[Array, "dim"]): The position at which to compute the laplacian value
    centers (Float[Array, "nb_centers, dim"]): The centroids of the RBF to use
    rbf (callable): The rbf to use. (Currently mandadatory, despite the signature.)

Returns:
    float: The laplacian of field at x
