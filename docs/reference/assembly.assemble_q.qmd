# assembly.assemble_q { #updes.assembly.assemble_q }

`assembly.assemble_q(operator, boundary_conditions, cloud, rbf, nb_monomials, rhs_args)`

Assemble the right hand side q using the given operator (See equation * from Shahane et al.)

Args:
    operator (callable): the rhs operator to apply
    boundary_conditions (dict): the boundary conditions to use
    cloud (Cloud): the cloud of points to use
    rbf (callable): the radial basis function to use
    nb_monomials (int): the number of monomials to use
    rhs_args (list): the fields to use in the application of the operator. Can be either the field values themselves or their coefficients

Returns:
    Float[Array, "nb_nodes"]: The vector q
