`operators.pde_solver(diff_operator, rhs_operator, cloud, boundary_conditions, rbf, max_degree, diff_args=None, rhs_args=None)`

Solve a PDE 
cloud: the cloud of points on which the PDE is solved
diff_operator: can take as input the coeffcients of a field
diff_args: can be either coeffs or values of the fields. Ultimately, only coefficients will be passed the diff operators
rhs_args: can be either coeffs or values of the fields. Ultimately, only coefficients will be passed the rhs operators
