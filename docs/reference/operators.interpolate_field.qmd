`operators.interpolate_field(field, cloud1, cloud2)`

Interpolates field from cloud1 to cloud2 given that their nodes might be numbered differently

Args:
    field (Float[Array, "dim"]): The field to interpolate
    cloud1 (Cloud): The cloud from which to interpolate
    cloud2 (Cloud): The cloud to which to interpolate. Must be same type as cloud1, but with different numbering of node, i.e. different boundary conditions

Raises:
    AssertionError: The two clouds do not contain the same number of nodes

Returns:
    Float[Array, "dim"]: The interpolated field
