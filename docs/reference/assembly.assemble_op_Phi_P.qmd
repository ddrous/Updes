# assembly.assemble_op_Phi_P { #updes.assembly.assemble_op_Phi_P }

`assembly.assemble_op_Phi_P(operator, cloud, rbf, nb_monomials, args)`

Assembles op(Phi) and op(P), the collocation and polynomial matrices after a differential operator is applied to internal nodes

Args:
    operator (callable): the differential operator to apply
    cloud (Cloud): the cloud of points to use
    rbf (callable): the radial basis function to use
    nb_monomials (int): the number of monomials to use
    args (list): the fields to use in the aplication of the operator. Can be either the field values themselves or their coefficients

Returns:
    tuple(Float[Array, "nb_internal_nodes nb_nodes"], Float[Array, "nb_internal_nodes nb_monomials"]): The internal operator matrices
