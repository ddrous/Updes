`operators.nodal_div_grad(x, center=None, rbf=None, monomial=None, args=None)`

Computes the laplacian as the divergence of the gradient of the rbf or polynomial at position x

Args:
    x (Float[Array, "dim"]): The position at which to evaluate the laplacian rbf or polynomial
    center (Float[Array, "dim"]): The centroid of the RBF if used. (Currently mandadatory, despite the signature.)
    rbf (callable): The rbf to use. (Currently mandadatory, despite the signature.)
    monomial (callable): The monomial to use. (Currently mandadatory, despite the signature.)

Returns:
    float: The value of the laplacian rbf or polynomial at x
