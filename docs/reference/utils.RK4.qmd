# utils.RK4 { #updes.utils.RK4 }

`utils.RK4(fun, t_span, y0, *args, t_eval=None, subdivisions=1, **kwargs)`

Numerical integration with RK4 and fixed-time stepping, but with fine subdivisions of the evaluation time intervals

Args:
    fun (Callable): The function to be integrated.
    y0 (Float[Array]): The initial condition.
    t_span (Tuple): The time interval for which the integration is to be performed.
    t_eval (Float[Array]): The time points at which the solution is to be evaluated.
    subdivisions (int): To improve stability, each interval in t_eval is divided into this many subdivisions. Consider increasing this if you obtain NaNs.
    *args: Additional arguments to be passed to the function.
    **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the function.

Raises:
    Warning: if t_span[0] is None.
    ValueError: if t_eval is None and t_span[1] is None.

Returns:
    Float[Array, "nb_time_steps"]: The solution at the time points in t_eval.
