`assembly.assemble_B(operator, cloud, rbf, nb_monomials, diff_args, robin_coeffs)`

Assemble matrix B using opPhi, bdPhi, opP, bdP, and A, see equation (*) from Shahane et al.

Args:
    operator (callable): the differential operator to apply
    cloud (Cloud): the cloud of points to use
    rbf (callable): the radial basis function to use
    nb_monomials (int): the number of monomials to use
    diff_args (list): the fields to use in the aplication of the operator. Can be either the field values themselves or their coefficients
    robin_coeffs (dict): the coefficients for the Robin boundary conditions if needed

Returns:
    Float[Array, "dim1 nb_nodes"]: The matrix B to use in the PDE solver
