`operators.cartesian_gradient(node_id, field, cloud, clip_val=None)`

Computes the gradient of the field (given by its values) at a specific node of a cartesian grid, using finite differences

Args:
    node_id (int): The node at which to conmpute the gradient value
    field (Float[Array, "nb_grid_points"]): The field to use for the gradient computation
    cloud (Cloud): The cloud of points to use: must be a square grid
    clip_val (float, optional): The limit to which to clip the value to avoid blowup. Defaults to None.

Returns:
    Float[Array, "dim"]: The gradient of the field at x
