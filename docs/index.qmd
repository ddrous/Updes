𝕌pdes is a general-purpose library for mesh-free PDE simulation and control.

It supports:

- User-centric design: no need to re-implement a solver for each new PDE
- Lightning fast mesh-free simulation via Radial Basis Functions
- Robust differentiable simulation via JAX, and portable across CPU, GPU, and TPU
- Support for Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and Periodic boundary conditions
- Automatic generation of normals from 2D GMSH meshes
- 𝕌pdes in incredibly extendable, with additional features added frequently.
- Many more to come...

To get started using this library:

- Install the package with: `pip install updes`.
- Follow the tutorials from [Examples](./examples.qmd). 
- Go further by reading the [API](reference/index.qmd).

We welcome contributions in all areas above. Please feel free to open up an issue or a pull request if anything is unclear 🙂.
